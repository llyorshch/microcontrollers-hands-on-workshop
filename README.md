# Microcontrollers - Hands-on workshop 🙌🎮🛜🏠🤖

![microcontrollers](microcontrollers.avif)

In this session we will explore 🕵‍♂ the amazing world of the modern microcontrollers. In the last 20 years there has been huge leap in what can be done with small and cheap chips.  [Arduino](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/) started this and it continues to be one of thae major platforms but many followed its trail and expanded the way microcontrollers can be used nowadays. The most notable platform is the [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) family of microcontrollers, offering integrated Wi-Fi and BT  connectivity 🛜 .

We will start with a brief introduction to microcontrollers 🧑‍🏫, why they are so cool and what can be done with them. As examples we will use:
- 5x [Adafruit Pybadge](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-pybadge/overview) gaming 🎮 handhelds
- An ESP32 starter-kit with plenty of sensors and other components
- 2x ESP32 LoRa Development boards for [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/) connectivity (if the Gods of AliExpress allow it 🙏)

After the presentation, we will form groups to play 🛝 with all the toys 🧸 we will bring to the workshop 🧑‍🏭. We will prepare some ideas 💡 beforehand but, we highly encourage you to bring your own! 💭

Don't forget to bring your laptop 💻 and if you have your own microcontroller related stuff bring it as well. It would be awesome to share our experiences and experiments 🔬 .
